### Install AWS CLI & Verify it's working
---
I admit, intitally I struggled with the installation process but was able to stick with it this is what I did on my local machine: 
1. download the zip file
2. unpacked the zip file
3. installed AWSCLI
4. verified a new instance/workspace would run AWSCLI
5. Commit my changes to Github and verify my work (<em>which included making sure aws keys were set in user-settings on GitPod</em>)

``` curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```
Once that was completed, I needed to verify the installation would run if I launched my workbook fresh (new) so I closed out of my session and relaunched my workspace as a new instance and then I ran into an error
```invalud gitpod.yml: unparsable Gitpod configuration: YAMLException: end the stream or document separator is expected at line 10, colum 1: vscode:^ ``` After review and backtracking to trace my steps, I had accidently deleted the word tasks: within the command that executes AWSCLI from GitPod on intitial launch. I corrected that mistake and commited the changes, this resolved the issue yay! commit [here](https://github.com/cloudtrailblaze/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml)
